# International-Soccer-Matches
Section 1:

I’m interested in this dataset because I really like soccer and I follow it a lot. Also, it gives me a lot of information about this topic in the international field.

I found this dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brenda89/fifa-world-cup-2022?resource=download

The person that created this dataset is called Brenda L.

This dataset was created around 2 years ago but it covers all the international matches played from 1993 to 2022

This dataset contains information about international soccer matches during the years, giving a lot of details of every match (scores, places that the matches were played in, nations, FIFA ranks, etc.)

Section 2:

The structure of the data is rectangular because it is a csv file and is uses rows and columns.

This data has a coarse granularity because each row represents an international soccer game.

The scope of the data is too big because it focusses on games, having scores and team that wins but not information about the players.

The soccer game data was collected from 1993 to 2022, the data has the information when has been collected.

This data has a good faithfulness, it has some missing rows but those rows doesn’t matter for the data I’m using it for. The data is very believable because it has the exact same information of each game that it can be found on internet.
