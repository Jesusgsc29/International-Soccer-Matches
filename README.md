# International-Soccer-Matches

Iâ€™m interested in this dataset because I really like soccer and I follow it a lot. Also, it gives me a lot of information about this topic in the international field.

I found this dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brenda89/fifa-world-cup-2022?resource=download

The person that created this dataset is called Brenda L.

This dataset was created around 2 years ago but it covers all the international matches played from 1993 to 2022

This dataset contains information about international soccer matches during the years, giving a lot of details of every match (scores, places that the matches were played in, nations, FIFA ranks, etc.)
